	--> DO NOT LET JOBS STALL/SLEEP, it prevents the job thread from consuming. In those cases it's best to spin up a dedicated thread ( e.g. Logger thread ).
		FileRead-style I/O tasks fall under this umbrella.
	--> No critical sections in a job.
	--> NEVER have a while true loop in these worker job functions.
